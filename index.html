        <p class="gameInfo">
            Anti-Monopoly is a board game that was created by economist Elizabeth Magie in 1903 and was later published in 1974 by University Games. The game is intended to be a critique of monopolies and capitalism, and it provides players with a choice between playing as either a monopolist or a competitor.<br><br>
            In the game, players move around the board and buy properties, similar to the popular game Monopoly. However, the gameplay mechanics are different from Monopoly, as players are allowed to choose whether they want to be a monopolist or a competitor. Monopolists can charge high rent prices, while competitors can offer lower prices to attract customers.<br><br>
            The game also includes legal battles and other challenges that can help players gain advantages or hinder their opponents. The ultimate goal of the game is to accumulate wealth and become the wealthiest player on the board.<br>
            Anti-Monopoly has been praised for its innovative gameplay and for its critique of monopolies and capitalism. It provides a different perspective on economic systems and encourages players to think critically about the role of monopolies in society.<br><br>
